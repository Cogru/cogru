> Where the collaboration start!?

[![CI](https://github.com/Cogru/cogru/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Cogru/cogru/actions/workflows/test.yml)

## üöß Project status

The code in this repository is currently under active development, and may
therefore change substantially with each commit.

## üîß Usage

Run the server in the current working directory without requiring the password
to be entered.

```sh
$ cogru . --no-password
```

## üí° Rationale

Cogru aims to streamline pair programming, ensuring it operates seamlessly
without duplicating the features of other existing software, such as chat and
screen sharing. Our focus will be solely on enhancing the editing experience
and facilitating communication between workspaces from start to finish.

- [ ] Emacs ([cogru.el][])
- [ ] Sublime Text ([cogru-sublime][])
- [ ] Vim
